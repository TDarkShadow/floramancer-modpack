- Ideal Vision:
    > Lexica by default shows no creative recipes
    > My Galactic Potato quest is to right click a potato with the Lexica, won't trigger before flower advancements
    > Trigger custom chat message when right clicking potato with items
        * Non-galactics when clicked with Lexica
            -> "I can't really contribute anything new to this. Perhaps my father would know more?"
        * Galactic when clicked without all flower quests
            -> "It seems you have not yet mastered all the flowers. You are not yet worthy of my secrets."
        * Galactic when clicked with all pre-requisites
            -> "You have proven yourself worthy. Take this book, in which I have now inscribed the secrets of infinite mana."
    > If custom chat messages can see what achievements have been gotten, perhaps require additional quests to be done.
    > Once creative recipes unlocked, they show in the Lexica (and JEI)
    > Both creative recipes require different custom structures. The pool gets transformed in world.
- Figure Lexica / Recipe Staging
    > Current Best option seems to be to award trophy items with the mana quests, and use them in the structure
    > Game stages should take care of JEI, but want some way to stage Lexica content
- Creative Recipes
    > Creative Tablet
        * Something inspired by the starlight infusion altar, but with mana pools instead of liquid starlight
        * Recipe consumes number of mana pools in the structure (12?)
    > Creative Pool
        * Fabulous pool in the center. This gets transformed in world.
        * Galactic potato is consumed, returning a tiny potato with a rainbow enchantment
        * Tiny potato with enchantment can be regrown into galactic with mana infusion (creative pool only)
