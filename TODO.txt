    > Creative Tablet
        * Something inspired by the starlight infusion altar, but with mana pools instead of liquid starlight
        * Recipe consumes number of mana pools in the structure (12?)
    > Creative Pool
        * Fabulous pool in the center. This gets transformed in world.
        * Galactic potato is consumed, returning a tiny potato with a rainbow enchantment
        * Tiny potato with enchantment can be regrown into galactic with mana infusion (creative pool only)

Optional / Uncertain End Game Content

- Immersive Creative Lexica Recipes
    > Craft by giving the potato the book instead of crafting
    > Might require Feature Request
    > Once done, change galactic potato quest to be right click potato with Lexica
- Trigger custom chat message when right clicking potato with items
    > Non-galactics when clicked with Lexica
        -> "I can't really contribute anything new to this. Perhaps my ancestors/father would know more?"
    > Galactic when clicked without all flower quests
        -> "It seems you have not yet mastered all the flowers. You are not yet worthy of my secrets."
    > Galactic when clicked with all pre-requisites
        -> "You have proven yourself worthy. Take this book, in which I have now inscribed the secrets of infinite mana."
    > If custom chat messages can see what achievements have been gotten, perhaps require additional quests to be done.
