- Figure out what's possible
	> Can I trigger a chat message when right clicking galactic potato
	- Can I trigger quest when right clicking galactic potato
	- Can I add pages to the Lexica based on game stages or other interaction
- Advancements or Quests?
    > Advancements
        * Pros:
            - Might be able to get closer to the thing I actually want to stage on
            - Can definitely get closer to end of pack vision (talk to the potato)
            - Generally a lot cleaner than a very sparse quest book
        * Cons:
            - Requires pull/feature request to Botania Tweaks?
            - Less guidance for players
    > Quests
        * Pros:
            - Pretty much already set up, so less work
        * Cons:
            - Not very close to ideal pack vision
            - Better Questing gui scale is broken
- Staging
    > If using Triumph/Advancements
        * Set stage once all flower advancements/potato quest/botania challenges
        * Probably need to stage off of a single quest. If so, make quest to right click potato with Lexica
    > If Using Quests:
        * Trigger gamestage command as reward for galactic potato quest
    > Either way, actually add Game Stages (plus whatever addons) and configure
- Creative Recipes
    > Simple: Runic altar Recipe
        * Dice of Fate or Gaia Guardian Head?
    > Harder: Custom terraglomeration recipe with BotaniaTweaks
        * Something inspired by the starlight infusion altar, but with mana pools instead of liquid starlight
        * Recipe consumes number of mana pools in the structure
