        * Something that looks like <flower>, but isn't functional and doesn't decay (placed on enchanted soil?)
        * Trophy like AoE, but livingrock slab as base
    > Creative Tablet
        * Something inspired by the starlight infusion altar, but with mana pools instead of liquid starlight
        * Recipe consumes number of mana pools in the structure (12?)
    > Creative Pool
        * Fabulous pool in the center. This gets transformed in world.
        * Galactic potato is consumed, returning a tiny potato with a rainbow enchantment
        * Tiny potato with enchantment can be regrown into galactic with mana infusion (creative pool only)
