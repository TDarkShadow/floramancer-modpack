# Floramancer

## Info

Floramancer is a modpack designed to be a Vanilla + Quark + Botania expert pack. There are relatively few other mods 
in the pack providing content, all of them chosen to have minimal impact on a playthrough focusing on those mods.

The goal of the pack is to fully automate every generating flower in Botania. You will need to do this even though 
*all* generating flora suffer passive decay in this pack (unless you're in Easy mode). Once you've accomplished this,
you will be able to craft the Creative Mana Tablet, followed by the Everlasting Guilty Pool!


## Current Features

- **Pack Modes** - There are three pack modes: Easy, Normal, and Hard. In Normal or Easy mode, no recipes are changed 
    except for the minor recipe tweaks mentioned below. In Hard mode, generating flora have been tweaked to use 
    somewhat different runes, and the runes themselves have more varied ingredients. The new runic recipes are designed
    not to be strictly more expensive, but rather to contain new ingredients that there was previously no reason to
    automate except for decorative purposes, such as metamorphic stone and clay.

- **Botania Tweaks** - The following tweaks are enabled:
    - Spectrolus and Entropinyum are buffed (Easy mode only)
	- Corporea is available earlier through the use of the corporea spork (Easy and Normal mode only)
    - All generating flora suffer passive decay after one real world hour. If properly utilized, all flowers still 
      produce far more mana than it takes to make them. (Normal and Hard mode only)
    - Automate crafting Ender Air with a Dispenser in the End dimension.
    - Automatically place Corporea Sparks and decorate them with Floral Powder, when you place corporea blocks.
    - Galactic Potato, because who doesn't want a huge, rainbow potato?
  
- **Recipe Tweaks** - Because generating flora all suffer from passive decay, the Dandelifeon and Shulk Me Not now 
    require pixie dust and ender air in place of a (non-automatable) gaia spirit. All other recipes remain unchanged 
    (in Easy or Normal mode anyway)

- **Infinite Lava** - Lava in the Nether is infinite below y = 32 (The level of the lava lakes). This allows for the 
    full automation of the thermalilly, something which isn't possible in pure Botania.
    
- **Garden of Glass Compatibility** - There are no recipe changes that should interfere with progression in a Garden of
    Glass world.


## Planned Features

- **Player's Choice** - Choose your preferred mapping mod, WAILA substitute, and gravestone mod.

- **Better Questing** - A quest book. This will not be a guide book, but rather a book of bulk-automation quests to 
    acquire large amounts of all sorts of resources. The intent is for the player to set up automated systems to produce
    these resources, with the eventual goal of automatically producing each kind of generating flora. While the quests 
    cannot technically force you to automate the *use* of every flower, it's the hope that after crafting so many of
    them, the player will find a use for them to offset the creation cost.

- **Game Stages** - Game Stages is used for a singular purpose - to gate the creation of the creative mana tablet and
    pool behind the completion of the rest of the quest book.
