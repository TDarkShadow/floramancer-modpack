# Floramancer

## Info

Floramancer is a modpack designed to be a Vanilla + Quark + Botania expert pack. There are relatively few other mods 
in the pack providing content, all of them chosen to have minimal impact on a playthrough focusing on those mods.

The goal of the pack is to fully automate every generating flower in Botania. You will need to do this even though 
*all* generating flora suffer passive decay in this pack. Use the resulting mana to craft a Galactic Potato, which will 
grant you the secrets of the Creative Mana Tablet and Everlasting Guilty Pool!


## Current Features

- **Pack Modes** - There are two pack modes: Normal and Hard. There are currently only a few differences between the
    modes, the corporea spork, the passive decay timer, and the mana cost of the final items. See below for more 
    details.
    
- **Game Stages** - Game Stages is used for a singular purpose - to gate the creation of the creative mana tablet and
    pool. For each generating flower, there is an advancement to produce a certain number of mana pools worth of mana
    with that flower. You must complete them all to unlock the creative item recipes.

- **Botania Tweaks** - The following tweaks are enabled:
	- Corporea is available earlier through the use of the corporea spork (Normal mode only)
    - All generating flora suffer passive decay after one real world hour (Normal mode) or half an hour (Hard mode). If 
      properly utilized, all flowers still produce far more mana than it takes to make them.
    - Automate crafting Ender Air with a Dispenser in the End dimension.
    - Automatically place Corporea Sparks and decorate them with Floral Powder, when you place corporea blocks.
    - Galactic Potato, because who doesn't want a huge, rainbow potato?
  
- **Recipe Tweaks** - 
	- Because generating flora all suffer from passive decay, the Dandelifeon and Shulk Me Not now require pixie dust
      and ender air in place of a (non-automatable) gaia spirit.
	- Several generating flora have been tweaked to use somewhat different runes, to better balance the distribution
	  of runes over recipes.
	- Tier two and three runes have been tweaked slightly to require more varied ingredients. The new runic recipes are
      designed not to be strictly more expensive, but rather to contain new ingredients that there was previously no
	  reason to automate except for decorative purposes, such as metamorphic stone, clay, and the different kinds of
	  Botania quartz.
	- By default, the mana cost of the Galactic Potato is equivalent to just under 52 Rank SS Terra Shatterers. In Hard 
	  mode, this is unchanged, while in Normal mode, the cost reduced to less than a tenth of that. The amount of mana
	  players are required to produce with each flower is adjusted accordingly.
	- The Fl√ºgel Tiara now requires the Elytra in its crafting recipe.

- **World Gen** - 
    - The default world type uses Quark's realistic terrain generation, combined with Traverse for some additional
      interesting biomes.
    - Recurrent Complex is used to add some structures to the world. If you go exploring, you might be able to find
      creeper spawners in the overworld, which should help with powering your entropinnyums, and enderman spawners in
      The End, which can save you time spent AFK waiting for natural Enderman spawns. Neither are required for
      progression though, so don't sweat it if you don't find any.

- **Infinite Lava** - Lava in the Nether is infinite below y = 32 (The level of the lava lakes). This allows for the 
    full automation of the thermalilly, something which isn't possible in pure Botania. If that's too easy for you, you
    can also employ some trickery with the Flame Resistant Saddle from Horse Tweaks.
    
- **Garden of Glass Compatibility** - There are no recipe changes that should interfere with progression in a Garden of
    Glass world.


## Planned Features

- **Player's Choice** - Choose your preferred mapping mod, WAILA substitute, chunk loader, and gravestone mod. This mod 
    currently seems to be incompatible with the latest Forge.
