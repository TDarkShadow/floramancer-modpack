# Floramancer

## Info

Floramancer is a modpack designed to be a Vanilla + Quark + Botania expert pack. There are relatively few other mods 
in the pack providing content, all of them chosen to have minimal impact on a playthrough focusing on those mods.

The goal of the pack is to fully automate every generating flower in Botania. You will need to do this even though 
*all* generating flora suffer passive decay in this pack. Use the resulting mana to craft a Galactic Potato, which will 
grant you the secrets of the Creative Mana Tablet and Everlasting Guilty Pool!
