Mods Updates:
Botania (important bugfix)
Quark
Worley's Caves

Enchancements:
Enabled quark speleothems now that they won't spawn above ground
Made Worley's Caves break through to the surface super rarely, given how bad it looks when that happens
Re-profiled with JER, so Earthworks blocks are shown

Bugfixes:
Creeper spawner advancement is unacheivable in GoG. Added a note to that effect and made it autocomplete in that case.
