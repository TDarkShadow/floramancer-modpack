- Right click potato with flower to see achievement progress


---------------
Tweaks
---------------

- Add <minecraft:enchanted_golden_apple> -> overgrowth seed alchemy catalyst recipe
- ContentTweaker - Make trophy flowers placeable in world
    > Might require not just using botania models, if the enchantment thing doesn't carry over
- Change color of creative pool recipe?
- Additional Advancements
    > creeper/enderman spawners
    > fully upgraded saddle
    > waystone?
    > smash tiny potato with an anvil?
- Additional Lexica Pages
    > Autumnal sapling/leaves recipes
    > Add recipe page to overgrowth seed entry
    > Entry for trophy flowers
- Potato recipes
    > See if Enchanted tiny -> galactic recipe can be made to require NBT
    > If so, either ask quat again about potatoes keeping enchantments in world, or make a staged recipe for the tiny


---------------
Bug Fixes
---------------

- Disable overworld structures only if GoG
    > Or maybe just find the underground ones and edit to not spawn in air
- Add Lexica entry tagline
- Fix JER mob drops, if possible
    - Remove tooltip for tallow once done


---------------
Things to Check
---------------

- New hidden quests are hidden and work
    > Give potato a book, should do nothing if no prerequisites
    > Complete prerequisites, shouldn't complete quest prematurely
    > Give potato a book again - chat message
    > Right click empty hand without retrieving lexica, should do nothing
    > Retrieve Lexica, should get replaced
    > Actual quest gets completed
    > Aside from the actual quest, all the above steps can be repeated
    > If above all work, change description of creativeLexicon amd remove shapeless recipe and tooltip
- Run /ct names modid
- Dispensers place anvils
- Smash potatoes with anvil
- All changed recipes as they appear in the Lexica
- Player's Choice descriptions
- Leave loonium running for a while and see what the distribution is like (ensure notch apple exists)
